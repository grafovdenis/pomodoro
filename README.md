## General info
At the moment, the application contains 2 screens: HomePage and StartedActivity. On the first one, you can set the activity time with the slider and indicate its name, as well as view already completed activities by swiping to the right.
After clicking on “Start”, the user goes to the StartedActivity screen, where the “Stop” button is located to cancel the activity, as well as the remaining time.
As the remaining time decreases, the screen fills with water.
